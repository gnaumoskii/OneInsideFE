# OneInsideFE

### IMPORTANT NOTE:
I added some additional stylings to the page (after the on-site test) because I didn't have much time left to add proper styling to the task. 
<b> I did NOT make any additional changes to the functionality of the app </b> , only CSS files and HTML files were changed.
<br>
<br>
The latest commit includes the style changes made in overtime.
<br>
The commit that was made when I finished the task on-site is called: "Completed the task" <b> (May 25th - commit id: bad8fee) </b>
<br>
<br>
To check that commit, run the command:
<b>git checkout bad8fee <b/>
